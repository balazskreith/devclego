# devclego

**What is it?**

devclego is a simple framework written in C programming language.
I created it for building scalable applications for processing data.
The aim of the framework is to give you a not overcomplicated (at some part it might be) 
framework using threads, finite-stat-machines, fast accessable datamaps in a flow-based programming manner, 
so you can build various application processing data from scratch relively easy.
