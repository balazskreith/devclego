# devclego

**What is it?**

devclego is a simple framework written in C programming language.
I created it for building scalable applications for processing data.
The aim of the framework is to give you a not overcomplicated (at some part it might be) 
framework using threads, finite-stat-machines, fast accessable datamaps in a flow-based programming manner, 
so you can build various application processing data from scratch relively easy. And I know thousands of others and betters 
are already exists, then use them.

Anyway a longer description of the framework found here: https://goo.gl/ccnDmi
