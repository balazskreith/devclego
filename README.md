devclego
==================================

Design and implement a scalable and robust application is an issue even in a case of designing a single program processing a single datastream. Due to unpredicted restrictions and features coming on the way of realizing a single program, a fine grained decomposition and developing method avoid the exponentially increased developing complexity. Finite state machine is a good manner for reacting events interrupts and influence the program and flow-based programming paradigm[1] is a well defined method for decompose functional elements. devclego is a skeleton for writing a program in C language 
processing data using threads, signals, puffers and arbitrary connectable components.
